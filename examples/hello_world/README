This demo is demonstrating the skeletons of all DCL application types to
provide a classical "Hello, world!" greeting.

console_application prints "Hello, world!" on terminal screen and exists. Try
to play with default command line options (see console_application -h).

daemon_application runs in a background process. Under Microsoft Windows it
required to be installed as Windows Service (see daemon_application -h). This
program writes "Hello, world!" in system log every 10 seconds.

gui_application shows standard dialog window with "Hello, world".
